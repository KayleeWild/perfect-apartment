# **Perfect Apartment**
This is a site I used to organize my research for my English 301 class. It is soley an informational site with virtually no dynamic capabilities. 
The "sources" tab includes an embedded spreadsheet and bibliography citing my sources. People looking for fast facts should start there. Users looking for more of a blog-style narrative about the best-rating sites should explore the different tabs.
My research process is detailed below...
## _Purpose:_
To determine what housing is the best overall for married couples at BYU-Idaho. The project
will analyze cost, amenities, furnishing, utilities, proximity to campus, and overall quality of the housing.
## _Research Question:_
Which housing option is the best overall for married students at BYU-Idaho?
## _Methodology:_
Over the course of this project I plan to use mainly secondary resources. Many of the housing complexes have websites that give detailed information, but many don’t. I’ll have to use third-party websites for some places as well. I also will use google maps to determine the distance each complex is from a specific place on campus. I will also use the google reviews given to determine the quality. I will also use some primary research.
## _Benefits:_
This project will benefit anyone who is newly married and looking for the best place to live in Rexburg according to various criteria. It will serve as a common place to get a feel for their options and then have resources to learn more.
## _Products:_
I have decided to create this project in the form of a web page that ranks each married complex in various criterion. Each section will include a brief synopsis of the pros and cons and a link to the actual website if applicable.
